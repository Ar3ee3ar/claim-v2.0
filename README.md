# claim_web
The project claims product for subject System analysis and design in the sophomore year that continues from a project in the same name from semester 1 (in Python). I learned about designing diagrams to plan this website and collect UX that was used to draw wireframes. I'm a front-end developer on this website with a little help from a template from colorlib (that I'm very grateful for that)
